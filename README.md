# USAPhO-Notes
Just some notes while studing for USAPhO

It's a work in progress, and it doesn't have many practice problems. I only created this back in the day while I was studying for USAPhO myself.

This is NOT a substitute for a textbook. It assumes you have at least some prior experience with the subject and it is only meant to serve as a
quick refresher if you need it.

I will continue to add more near the end because Quantum Mechanics and optics is definitely lacking. This is because I never got around to adding it
to the document.
